# Mob Ascension (NeoForge 1.21.1)

Mob Ascension turns ordinary hostile mobs into **champions**. Every time a monster spawns, there is a chance it ascends into one of four ranks: **Veteran, Elite, Mythic or Apex**. Each rank is tougher, deadlier and more rewarding than the last, with rank-coloured glow and particles, rolled stat levels, random abilities, real gear and loot that scales with the fight.

Apex champions are the true threat: they hunt you down, hurl wither skulls and fireballs, and drop a haul worth the trouble.

## Ranks (4)

| Rank    | Colour | Stat level (random) | Spawn odds | Abilities | Health bonus | Damage bonus |
| ------- | ------ | ------------------- | ---------- | --------- | ------------ | ------------ |
| Veteran | Green  | 3 - 5               | ~5.5%      | 1         | +30-50%      | +21-35%      |
| Elite   | Aqua   | 5 - 8               | ~1.5%      | 2         | +80-128%     | +45-72%      |
| Mythic  | Purple | 7 - 11              | ~0.5%      | 3         | +210-330%    | +98-154%     |
| Apex    | Gold   | 10 - 14             | ~0.11%     | 4         | +400-560%    | +180-252%    |

About 92% of spawns stay normal mobs. The Warden, Ender Dragon, Wither, Creeper and Vex can never ascend. Mobs from spawners, trial spawners, breeding, buckets and conversions are excluded by default.

### How champions work
- **Random power:** every champion rolls its own stat level inside its rank's range, so no two are exactly alike
- **Stats:** extra health, armor, toughness, movement speed, attack damage, knockback resistance, safe fall distance and body size; immune to fire and lava
- **Ranged damage:** the damage bonus also applies to arrows, tridents and fireballs
- **Effects:** permanent Infested or Oozing, with higher ranks more likely to roll them (5% / 10% / 20% / 35% each)
- **Presence:** rank-coloured particle aura, rank in the mob's name (e.g. "Veteran Zombie"), and a coloured glow outline on Apex when they spawn
- **Announcements:** Apex spawns are announced to nearby players; Mythic and Apex deaths set off fireworks
- **Gear:** champions are armed and armoured by rank (leather and chainmail up to netherite), with random vanilla armor trims and enchantments capped per rank

## Abilities (9)

Champions roll random abilities, and higher ranks roll more. Each one has its own minimum rank, power and cooldown in the config.

| Ability     | Min rank | Effect                                                    |
| ----------- | -------- | --------------------------------------------------------- |
| Vampiric    | Veteran  | Heals for a share of the damage it deals                  |
| Thorned     | Veteran  | Reflects part of the melee damage you deal back at you    |
| Frostbite   | Veteran  | Slows and freezes on hit                                  |
| Venomous    | Veteran  | Poisons on hit                                            |
| Berserker   | Elite    | Enrages at 50% HP: faster and hits harder                 |
| Blinker     | Elite    | Teleports next to you from up to 16 blocks away           |
| Volatile    | Mythic   | Explodes on death (no block damage)                       |
| Splitting   | Mythic   | Spawns two minions on death                               |
| Stormcaller | Apex     | Calls lightning down on you                               |

## Apex champions

- **Ranged attacks:** only Apex shoot, firing **wither skulls and large fireballs** at their target
- **They hunt you:** an Apex automatically targets the nearest survival player within 30 blocks, no provocation needed
- **Passive mobs (optional):** with `includePassiveMobs` on, passive mobs can ascend too, and an Apex passive mob hunts players with wither skulls and fireballs. Off by default

## Rewards

Rewards grow with rank. A champion killed by a player gives:

| Rank    | Guaranteed loot                                                                 | Reward rolls | Random enchanted books | Kill XP levels |
